# Custom Record Parsing

This module contains a single project that uses a custom `LineTokenizer` and `FieldSetMapper` to read CSV files.  This project contains separate profiles for running CSV files with two separate scenarios &ndash; a single record CSV and a multiple record CSV formats.

The implementation of each tokenizer and mapper is straight and just exercises the use of each interface.
